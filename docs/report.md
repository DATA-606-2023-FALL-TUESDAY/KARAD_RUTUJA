## 1. Background:

The project focuses on detecting fake news, addressing the urgent need for reliable information in today's digital landscape. Fake news can distort public opinion and threaten societal harmony. Thus, the aim is to develop an effective tool for automated fake news detection to enhance information credibility and combat misinformation.

In an age where false information can disrupt societies and even impact national security, our work seeks to empower individuals and organizations to make more informed decisions.

This project aims to answer research inquiries including but not limited to evaluating machine learning and natural language processing algorithms for fake news detection, analyzing metadata and linguistic patterns, and understanding the spread of fake news in society.

## 2. Goal:

This project aims to use natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify whether a piece of news is fake or real.<br>

| 4   | date    | 23481            | object    | Date on which the article was posted.                                                                      |

## 5. Features:

The input variables will be 'title' and 'text'. The output variable will be a categorical with values '0' for fake news and '1' for news that is true.The category feature has been added to both the datasets manually after importing them as dataframe.

## 6. Preprocessing and Data Inspection - Part I

1. **Checking for Null Values:**
   ![nullvalues](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/37034af6-1623-4107-bdcb-cd776f07accc)

   The dataset (combined) does not contain any null values.

3. **Dataset Information:**

- Fake.csv <br>
  ![fakeinfo](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/bc0229b8-62ff-46b7-8c46-1a31c2aa3132)
<br><br>
![realinfo](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/ee79b30f-8a68-4ede-9ad0-d2077f9b3449)
- Real.csv: <br>
  

3. **Concatenation of Datasets:** <br>
   The dataset is divided into two CSV files - `Fake.csv` and `Real.csv`. It is necessary to combine them and add a target variable - 0 for Fake News and 1 for True/Real News.

![combined](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/8197d8ff-e587-4345-a782-2fdab10785bf)


4. **Text Cleaning:**
   - **Removed Noise**: Stripping text of formatting (e.g., HTML tags, special characters, emojis).
   - **Lowercasing**: Converted the text to lowercase to maintain consistency since "Hello" and "hello" should be the same word for analysis.
   - **Removed Punctuation**: Punctuation was discarded.
   - **Removed Stop Words**: Common words like "is", "and", "the", etc., which do not contribute much meaning to the sentences were removed.
   - **Removed Numbers**: Numbers were removed or converted into textual representations.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Distribution of Fake and Real News:**

   ![piechart](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/79c13272-2b17-498c-b228-d832bcd93701)


- From the distribution of the total articles, 44.7% is real news and 55.3% is fake news. The distribution is pretty much equal.
- This will be advantageous in training as there is less chance of overfitting and high chances of good generalization.
  <br>
  <br>

2. **Timeline Visualization - Fake and Real News Articles Over Time:**

![timeline](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/4740798e-dc2b-4b00-9a2c-e71ed63f4820)

- The above graph describes the relation between the number of articles and the date when they were released.
- In general, there are a lot of fake articles compared to true articles, but we can observe a sharp spike during the 2016 election period.
- There seems to be a spike of true news articles during late 2017 which can be attributed to either being outliers or the data collection process.
  <br>
  <br>

3. **Analyzing the Distribution of Article Lengths by Category:**
   ![distbylengths](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/bc3b5724-6a3a-4bfd-9f4c-4d3dd1b2d334)
   - An important trend can be identified in this graph: fake news articles are much more verbose.
   - A study by Hanock and Dunham found that in written statements, if a person is lying or is not sure what they are saying is true, they often embellish the details of their conversation [1].
   - From the above graphs, we can see that the fake texts contain more characters and more words per article thus reinforcing the hypothesis laid down by the previous visualization.

4. **Word and Character Lengths in Articles by Category:**

|          Words          |          Characters           |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| ![wordcomparison](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/2e741d33-406e-4569-b9d7-605ac571f065) | ![characterscomparison](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/16e09369-afe1-4ed6-9ba8-63d60ae00eea) |

- From the above visualization, we can conclude that articles categorized as true have a higher average word length than articles categorized as fake.
- Generally, when a person is falsifying statements, they will make use of articles, prepositions abundantly [1].
- A person telling the truth will be much more articulate and concise in their use of words [1].
- Thus, the above inference that true news articles having less average word length holds true.
  <br>
  <br>

Thus, from the above graphs, we can see that the fake texts contain more characters and more words per article thus reinforcing the hypothesis laid down by the previous visualization.

<br>

6. **Word Cloud:**<br><br>
   
   ![wordcloud](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/6087bf2b-853f-4b53-b966-38504d5a1dc7)

   - From the word cloud, we can observe that the most commonly used words in fake news articles seem to be "said", "Donald Trump", "American", "think", "that", "Hillary Clinton", "will", "say", "might", "want", "country", "left".
   - Most of the above words can be used to represent suggestion and supposition in speech.

## 8. Preprocessing - Part II (NLP):

The following preprocessing steps required in NLP were performed.

1. **Tokenization:**

   - **Sentence Tokenization**: The text was split into individual sentences.
   - **Word Tokenization**: The text was split into individual words or tokens.

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging:**

   - Assigned part-of-speech tags to each token to understand sentence grammar.

3. **Stemming and Lemmatization:**

   - **Stemming**: Reduced words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
   - **Lemmatization**: Contextually linked words with similar meanings to one word (e.g., "better" to "good").

4. **Word2Vec Embeddings:**
   - Word2Vec is an approach to word embeddings that involves mapping words into a dense vector space where semantic meanings of words are captured based on their context in the corpus.
   - Convert a sentence to its average word vector representation using a Word2Vec model.

## 9. Model Training:

#### 9 a. Feature Extraction:

Feature extraction was done from the text using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. The TF-IDF Vectorizer was used for POS Tags. Word2Vec features were used as is because they were in a matrix format.
<br><br>
The classifiers selected are: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradien Descent, Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression. There were two approaches - POS Tagging and Word2Vec embeddings. All the classifiers were first trained after performing POS Tagging on the preprocessed data and then after performing Word2Vec Embeddings on the preprocessed data.

#### 9 b. Comparison of Model Training:

- Word2Vec embeddings consistently outperform POS tags across all classifiers. This indicates the rich semantic information captured by Word2Vec, which is crucial for this fake news classification task.

- Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Stochastic Gradient Descent have similar performance when trained on Word2Vec embeddings. Random Forest, although slightly more computationally intensive, offers robustness and also performs exceptionally well with Word2Vec.

  ![model](https://github.com/DATA-606-2023-FALL-TUESDAY/KARAD_RUTUJA/assets/144069633/17b7766e-c20c-42cd-a245-477cee1896aa)


- Given the high F1 scores and computational efficiency, Logistic Regression with Word2Vec embeddings stands out as a top candidate. Random Forest with Word2Vec is also a strong contender, offering robustness and adaptability to potential changes in the type of data.

Logistic Regression was chosen as the final classifier.

#### 9 c. Hyperparameter Optimization:

Different values of "C" were tested with L2 Penalty. Best values obtained - 10, 100. The best model was saved for later use.
